The purpose of my project is to see if there is a statistically significant effect between driving distance and purse money won on the PGA Tour. While this topic doesn't necessarily have an "advancing the common good" aspect, it is something that is very interesting to me and motivating to do an in-depth statistical analysis. I hope that is OK for this project.

I did fill in the first three sections of the README template to answer those questions.

Overall, my goal is to not only answer the null hypothesis: driving distance does not impact purse money won. But if my analysis allows me to reject that null hypothesis, so some analysis on the correlation between driving distance and money won.

Also, if time permits, I'd like to analyze other performance metrics in relation to money won - driving accuracy (what percentage of fairways a player successfully hits) and proximity to the hole (how close, on average, a player hits approach shots to the hole). I would love to see these three metrics analyzed against money won and see which one is most statistically significant for success on the PGA Tour.
